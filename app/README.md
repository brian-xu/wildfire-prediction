# End User Application

The files in this directory are how I imagine an actual deployment of the model would work.
A single instance [(ml_model/)](ml_model) can handle all the predictions, while the actual
visualization website [(static/)](static) is more simplistic, basically only using 
[Leaflet.heat](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.heat).

# Data Processing

The trained model should be located at [ml_model/weights/firecast.pth](ml_model/weights/firecast.pth),
and all .tiff and .xml files generated by GDAL should be located under [ml_model/maps](ml_model/maps).

[gen_heat](ml_model/gen_heat.py) handles everything necessary for generating the predictions.

# Data Visualization

The visualization demo uses Leaflet and Leaflet.heat to display predictions. It imports all the
predictions from a single file, in this case named [latest.js](static/latest.js).
